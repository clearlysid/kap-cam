# kap-cam

> A [Kap](https://github.com/wulkano/kap) plugin that adds a Loom-like Webcam overlay to recordings.

## Installation

_(this does not currently work as the package is yet to be crawled by `npms.io`)_
In the `Kap` menu, go to `Preferencesâ€¦`, select the `Plugins` pane, find `cam` and toggle it.

## Usage

To enable or disable the overlay:

1. click the `â€¦` icon in the cropper or right-click the tray icon
2. select `Plugins`
3. check or uncheck `Show Camera`

Note that the Camera window does not appear until you start a recording.

## Notes

This is based off of [@karaggeorge's](https://github.com/karaggeorge) [kap-camera](https://github.com/karaggeorge/kap-camera/) plugin. The repo seemed to be inactive and I really wanted a more Loom-like flavour to its UI, so I decided to fork and maintain my own. Feel free to raise issues, leave feedback or contribute in any way you see fit. Cheers! ðŸ¥‚
